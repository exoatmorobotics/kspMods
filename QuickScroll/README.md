#### What is it?

QuickScroll is a small plugin which adds the possibility to scroll the parts pages, the categories and the filters on the editor with the mouse wheel and with keyboard shortcuts.

Shortcut:
    - When the mouse is on the part list:
        * Left CTRL + mouse wheel = scroll categories,
        * Left Shift + mouse wheel = scroll filters.
    - When the mouse is on the categories:
        * Left Shift or Left CTRL + mouse wheel = scroll filters.
    - Switch the default categories with Enter + KeyPad 1, KeyPad 2, KeyPad 3 ...
	- Previous/next page with Enter + left/right.
	- Previous/next category Enter + up/down.
	- Previous/next filter Enter + page up/page down.

I suggest you to look at the awesome mod PartCatalog which also has this feature (with many others nice features).
