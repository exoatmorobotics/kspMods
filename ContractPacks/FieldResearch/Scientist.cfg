    title = Field Research: Help a scientist perform experiments at @/biome.
    description = Renowned scientist @/SpawnPassengers/passengerName.First() would like to perform some experiments near a specific location at @/biome.  Wernher has strongly suggested that this scientist should be treated with the utmost respect, as they are a prominent member of the Society of Rocketologists.
    synopsis = Bring @/SpawnPassengers/passengerName.First() to perform experiments near @/waypoint.Name() at @/biome.
    completedMessage = Wernher is very pleased, he wouldn't have been able to attend the Rocketologist's gala if something had gone wrong!
