    title = Field Research: Geological study of @targetBody
    description = Geologically speaking, we know very little about @targetBody.  That's why we've applied for a research grant to do a geological study of @targetBody.  We haven't actually received the grant, but I'm sure things will work out fine.
    synopsis = Perform a study of @targetBody's geology.
    completedMessage = Great work, I hope Linus remembered to submit the grant paperwork!
