    description = There are lots of opportunities to do science around the Kerbal Space Center.  Wernher needs us to run a few tests at different locations as a control test of our experiments.
    synopsis = Run the required tests around the Kerbal Space Center and recover the data.
    completedMessage = Everything is looking good with these experiments, time to get them into space!
